# Personal website

This is my personal website where I share my projects and articles covering various topics related to science, programming, game development, and more.

This website is made with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>. It's very lightweight and performant, and its [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) work well for my blog. The support for different UI frameworks makes it easy to add projects that I've made with other technologies.
