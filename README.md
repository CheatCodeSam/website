# Personal website [joonaa.dev](https://joonaa.dev)

Hi! I'm Joona Aalto (Jondolf on GitHub), a Finnish high school student who is interested in science and programming.

This is my personal website where I share my projects and write about them or whatever else interests me. I like to dive deep into different topics to learn as much as I can, and I plan on making small devlogs or tutorials whenever I have built something interesting based on my research.

You can expect topics like physics simulation, algorithms, web development, game development, or whatever else I find to be interesting at a given time.

## Website structure

This website is made with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>. It's very lightweight and performant, and its [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) suit my use case quite well.

## Local development

If you want to run the website locally for any reason, you need to install the dependencies first. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed and run the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

Now you can simply start the local development server.

```shell
npm run dev
```
