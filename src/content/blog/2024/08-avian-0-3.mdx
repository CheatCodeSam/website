**Avian Physics 0.3** has been released! 🪶

[**Avian**](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian) is an ECS-based 2D and 3D physics engine for [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/),
a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. Avian prioritizes ergonomics and modularity,
with a focus on providing a native ECS-driven user experience.

Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian)
and [introductory post](https://joonaa.dev/blog/06/avian-0-1) for more details.

## Highlights

**Avian 0.3** is another huge release, with several new features, quality-of-life improvements, and important bug fixes. Highlights include:

- **Opt-in contact reporting**: Collision events are now only sent for entities that have the `CollisionEventsEnabled` component, reducing unwanted overhead and iteration.
- **Observable collision events**: Observers finally support collision events, making it easy to define per-entity collision handlers.
- **Collision hooks**: Users can "hook into" the collision pipeline, making it possible to efficiently filter and modify contacts.
- **Per-manifold material properties**: Friction, restitution, and tangent velocity can be modified for contact manifolds, allowing the simulation of non-uniform materials and conveyor belts.
- **Collider context**: Custom colliders that implement `AnyCollider` have a `Context` for ECS access.
- **Physics diagnostics**: Avian has built-in diagnostics and a debug UI for runtime physics profiling.
- **Reworked contact pair management**: Contacts have been massively reworked to reduce allocations and unnecessary work while increasing parallelism.
- **Faster collisions and spatial queries**: Collisions and spatial queries have much less overhead.
- **Bevy 0.16 support**: Avian has been updated to the latest version of Bevy, and is taking advantage of relationships for attaching colliders to rigid bodies.

The migration guide and a more complete changelog can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/releases/tag/v0.3.0).

## Opt-In Contact Reporting

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['Jondolf']} prs={[683]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

In previous releases, Avian has sent the `CollisionStarted`, `CollisionEnded`, and `Collision`
events for *all* contact pairs. This had fairly significant overhead for contact-heavy
scenarios, and often resulted in unnecessary iteration in user code. You rarely need
collision events for every collider in the world.

**Avian 0.3** introduces a new `CollisionEventsEnabled` component that can be added to enable
collision events for a collider. Collision events are only sent for a contact between two entities
if either of the colliders involved has this component.

```rust
commands.spawn((
    RigidBody::Kinematic,
    Collider::capsule(0.5, 1.5),
    // Enable collision events for this collider.
    CollisionEventsEnabled,
));
```

If you wish to revert to the old behavior, consider making `CollisionEventsEnabled` a required component
for `Collider` to insert it automatically:

```rust
app.register_required_components::<Collider, CollisionEventsEnabled>();
```

Finally, the `Collision` event no longer exists, as it unnecessarily duplicated lots of collision data.
Instead, use `Collisions` directly, or get colliding entities using the `CollidingEntities` component.

## Observable Collision Events

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['Jondolf']} prs={[704, 717]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

The `CollisionStarted` and `CollisionEnded` events can be read with an `EventReader`.
However, in a lot of cases, you only care about collisions involving a *specific* entity,
such as when a character walks over pickups or steps on a pressure plate. With `EventReader`,
this required iterating through all events and checking which entities were involved in the collision,
which was both inefficient and unergonomic.

**Avian 0.3** introduces new `OnCollisionStart` and `OnCollisionEnd` events that are triggered
for entities with the `CollisionEventsEnabled` component. They can be listened to with
Bevy's observers, making them well-suited for per-entity collision handling.

A simple example of a pressure plate that logs a message when a player steps on it:

```rust
#[derive(Component)]
struct Player;

#[derive(Component)]
struct PressurePlate;

fn setup_pressure_plates(mut commands: Commands) {
    commands.spawn((
        PressurePlate,
        Collider::cuboid(1.0, 0.1, 1.0),
        Sensor,
        // Enable collision events for this collider.
        CollisionEventsEnabled,
    ))
    // Observer for responding to collisions starting with the pressure plate.
    .observe(|trigger: Trigger<OnCollisionStart>, player_query: Query<&Player>| {
        // The trigger target is the entity that the observer is targeting.
        let pressure_plate = trigger.target();

        // The `collider` stored in the event is the entity that the target entity collided with.
        // There is also a `body` field for the rigid body that the collider is attached to.
        let other_entity = trigger.collider;

        // Check if the entity colliding with the pressure plate is a player.
        if player_query.contains(other_entity) {
            println!("Player {other_entity} stepped on pressure plate {pressure_plate}");
        }
    });
}
```

The buffered `CollisionStarted` and `CollisionEnded` events are still available, and are good
for efficiently processing large numbers of collisions between pairs of entities,
such as for playing sound effects on collision or responding to projectile hits.

## Collision Hooks

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['Jondolf']} prs={[610]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

Advanced contact scenarios often require filtering or modifying contacts with custom logic.
Use cases include:

- One-way platforms
- Conveyor belts
- Non-uniform friction and restitution for terrain

In previous releases, Avian had a `PostProcessCollisions` schedule that made some of these
scenarios possible by allowing users to freely add systems to operate on collision data
before contact constraints were generated for the solver. However:

- It didn't support filtering contact pairs in the broad phase, only after the narrow phase.
- It resulted in unnecessary iteration, as filtering and modification couldn't be done directly when contacts are being created or added.
- It prevented important optimizations from being implemented (see [Reworked Contact Pair Management](#reworked-contact-pair-management)).

As focus has shifted more towards performance, it became evident that `PostProcessCollisions`
was not the right approach. Instead, physics engines typically use *hooks* or *callbacks* that are called
during specific parts of the simulation loop.

**Avian 0.3** introduces a new `CollisionHooks` trait that allows users to define custom hooks
for efficiently filtering and modifying contact pairs. It supersedes the `PostProcessCollisions`
schedule, and allows users to hook directly into the collision pipeline.

### Defining Hooks

To define collision hooks, implement the `CollisionHooks` trait for a type implementing
`ReadOnlySystemParam`. The system parameter makes it possible to perform queries,
access resources, or otherwise read ECS data.

<Callout variant="note">
    Hooks only allow read-only ECS access because they may run in parallel with each other.
    However, deferred changes are still supported through `Commands` passed to the hooks.
    Note that the execution order for these commands is non-deterministic with the `parallel` feature.
</Callout>

An example of hooks to support interaction groups and one-way platforms might look like this:

```rust
use avian2d::prelude::*;
use bevy::{ecs::system::SystemParam, prelude::*};

/// A component that groups entities for interactions.
/// Only entities in the same group can collide.
#[derive(Component)]
struct InteractionGroup(u32);

/// A component that marks an entity as a one-way platform.
#[derive(Component)]
struct OneWayPlatform;

// Define a `SystemParam` for the collision hooks.
#[derive(SystemParam)]
struct MyHooks<'w, 's> {
    interaction_query: Query<'w, 's, &'static InteractionGroup>,
    platform_query: Query<'w, 's, &'static Transform, With<OneWayPlatform>>,
}

// Implement the `CollisionHooks` trait.
impl CollisionHooks for MyHooks<'_, '_> {
    // This is called in the broad phase, and acts as an early-out filter.
    fn filter_pairs(&self, collider1: Entity, collider2: Entity, _commands: &mut Commands) -> bool {
        // Only allow collisions between entities in the same interaction group.
        // This could be a basic solution for "multiple physics worlds" that don't interact.
        let Ok([group1, group2]) = self.interaction_query.get_many([collider1, collider2]) else {
            return true;
        };
        group1.0 == group2.0
    }

    // This is called in the narrow phase, and allows modifying or rejecting contact pairs.
    // Returning `false` will reject the contact, while returning `true` will keep it.
    fn modify_contacts(&self, contacts: &mut Contacts, commands: &mut Commands) -> bool {
        // Allow entities to pass through the bottom and sides of one-way platforms.
        // See the `one_way_platform_2d` example for a full implementation.
        let (entity1, entity2) = (contacts.collider1, contacts.collider2);
        !self.is_hitting_top_of_platform(entity1, entity2, &self.platform_query, &contacts, commands)
    }
}
```

The hooks can then be added to the app using `PhysicsPlugins::with_collision_hooks`:

```rust
fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins((
            DefaultPlugins,
            PhysicsPlugins::default().with_collision_hooks::<MyHooks>(),
        ))
        .run();
}
```

It is rare to want hooks to run for every single collision pair. Thus, hooks are *only* called
for collisions where at least one entity has the new `ActiveCollisionHooks` component with
the corresponding flags set. By default, no hooks are called.

```rust
// Spawn a collider with filtering hooks enabled.
commands.spawn((Collider::capsule(0.5, 1.5), ActiveCollisionHooks::FILTER_PAIRS));

// Spawn a collider with both filtering and contact modification hooks enabled.
commands.spawn((
    Collider::capsule(0.5, 1.5),
    ActiveCollisionHooks::FILTER_PAIRS | ActiveCollisionHooks::MODIFY_CONTACTS
));

// Alternatively, all hooks can be enabled with `ActiveCollisionHooks::all()`.
commands.spawn((Collider::capsule(0.5, 1.5), ActiveCollisionHooks::all()));
```

## Per-Manifold Material Properties

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['Jondolf']} prs={[660]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

The friction and restitution of a collider can be configured with the `Friction` and `Restitution`
components respectively. However, what if you wanted different friction or restitution
for different parts of a mesh, or wanted the material properties to change based on
the entities involved?

**Avian 0.3** stores `friction` and `restitution` properties for each contact manifold,
allowing you to modify the surface material properties of individual contacts
inside `CollisionHooks::modify_contacts`.

```rust
// Inside a `CollisionHooks` implementation (see previous section)
fn modify_contacts(&self, contacts: &mut ContactPair, _commands: &mut Commands) -> bool {
    // Iterate over all contact surfaces between the two colliders.
    for manifold in contacts.manifolds.iter_mut() {
        // Use a random coefficient of restitution between 0 and 1 for each contact.
        // Because why not?
        manifold.restitution = rand::random();
    }
    
    true
}
```

Additionally, a new `tangent_velocity` property is provided to emulate the artificial movement
of contact surfaces, making it possible to simulate scenarios such as conveyor belts or speed pads.

## Physics Picking Filter

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['morgenthum']} prs={[632]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

Avian has a `PhysicsPickingPlugin` that allows you to pick colliders in the world
using ray casts. In version 0.2, it required that the `RenderLayers` of cameras
and pickable colliders match, if specified. Using `RenderLayers` for mesh and sprite picking
makes sense to ensure that what you see is what you get, but for colliders,
there is no such connection to rendering or visuals. Instead, it would be
more useful to support the filtering options normally provided for ray casts.

**Avian 0.3** introduces a `PhysicsPickingFilter` to filter pickable entities
using a `SpatialQueryFilter`.

```rust
// Only enable picking NPCs with this camera.
commands.spawn((
    Camera2d,
    PhysicsPickingFilter::from_mask(GameLayer::Npc),
));
```

## Physics Diagnostics

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['Jondolf']} prs={[653]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

As Avian has grown, performance has been increasingly becoming more relevant.
However, to really be able to detect bottlenecks and determine how changes affect performance,
we need a way to profile the physics simulation.

**Avian 0.3** introduces built-in diagnostics for physics timers and counters with minimal overhead.
The results are stored in separate resources like `SolverDiagnostics` and `SpatialQueryDiagnostics`
to ensure that you're only tracking information for plugins that you actually use. Currently,
diagnostics are enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

Users could access and log these resources directly to monitor physics performance,
but as we will see, there are also built-in features for visualizing them more conveniently.

<Callout variant="note" title="Why not just use Tracy or flame graphs?">
    Tracy and flame graphs are valuable tools for profiling, but they're not as good for seeing results in real time,
    are somewhat inconvenient to set up, and have their own overhead. The new profiling tools are not a replacement
    for Tracy, but complement it with more targeted real-time physics performance monitoring.
</Callout>

### Integration With `DiagnosticsStore`

Bevy has its own `DiagnosticsStore` for storing diagnostics information and reading it
with smoothing and other convenience features. To integrate with this, **Avian 0.3**
adds a `bevy_diagnostic` feature and `PhysicsDiagnosticsPlugin` for writing Avian's
own diagnostics to the store.

```rust
app.add_plugins((
    DefaultPlugins,
    PhysicsPlugins::default(),
    // Enable writing physics diagnostics to Bevy's `DiagnosticsStore`.
    PhysicsDiagnosticsPlugin,
));
```

You can access a specific physics diagnostic from the `DiagnosticsStore` resource
using the diagnostic path stored as an associated constant in the corresponding
diagnostics resource.

```rust
// Not sure when you'd want to log a single diagnostic, but you can do it :D
fn log_narrow_phase_time(diagnostics: Res<DiagnosticsStore>) {
    // Get the diagnostic.
    let Some(diagnostic) = diagnostics.get(CollisionDiagnostics::NARROW_PHASE) else {
        return;
    };

    // Get the measurement and average.
    if let (Some(measurement), Some(average)) = (diagnostic.measurement(), diagnostic.average()) {
        let time = measurement.value;
        println!(
            "Narrow phase time: {time} (avg: {average}) {}",
            diagnostic.suffix
        );
    }
}
```

### Physics Diagnostics UI

Having all of these diagnostics available is nice and all, but viewing and displaying them
in a useful way involves a decent amount of code and effort.

To make this easier (and prettier!), an optional debug UI for displaying physics diagnostics
is provided with the `diagnostic_ui` feature and `PhysicsDiagnosticsUiPlugin`. It displays
all active built-in physics diagnostics in neat groups, with both current and average times shown.

<img alt="Physics diagnostics UI" src="/blog-assets/avian-0-3/diagnostic_ui.png" />

*Note: The text at the top right is not a part of the diagnostics UI, but a part of the examples.*

The UI can be configured using the `PhysicsDiagnosticsUiSettings` resource.

## Reworked Contact Pair Management

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['Jondolf']} prs={[683, 689]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

Most of the work this cycle was spent on reworking and optimizing contact pair management.
The goal was to significantly reduce allocations and unnecessary work while increasing parallelism
and allowing more efficient access to contacts associated with a given entity.

I will dive deep into some technical details here, but if you're not interested in the nitty-gritty,
you can skip to the [`Collisions` System Parameter](#collisions-system-parameter) section and the sections
that follow to see the user-facing impact.

### What Was Wrong?

In past releases, contact pair management had lots of inefficiencies:

- We collect all broad phase pairs from scratch to a `Vec` every frame.
- We iterate through all collisions at least *three* separate times every frame for handling contact status changes (reset statuses, report contacts, remove ended contacts).
- We have to do a lookup for previous contacts for every contact pair.
- The logic for resetting collision statuses involves ECS queries and confusing state management.
- The loop over pairs found by the broad phase collects collisions into new vectors every time.

Overall, there was an excessive amount of iteration and allocations,
and the logic for managing contact statuses was very confusing,

In addition, the `Collisions` resource itself was not efficient enough for our purposes.
There are many cases where you may need to iterate over contacts associated with a specific entity,
but this required a linear scan through *all* collisions. To resolve this, a more graph-like structure is needed.

### The New Approach

**Avian 0.3** changes `Collisions` to a `ContactGraph` (more on that in the next section),
and reworks contact pair management to look like the following:

1. Find *new* pairs in the broad phase and add them to the `ContactGraph` directly. Duplicate pairs are avoided with fast lookups into a `HashSet<PairKey>`.
2. Iterate over all pairs in the `ContactGraph` in parallel, maintaining thread-local bit vectors to track contact status changes (i.e. creation or removal). For each contact pair:
	1. Test if AABBs still overlap.
	2. If the AABBs are disjoint, set `ContactPairFlags::DISJOINT_AABB` and the status change bit for this contact pair. Continue to the next pair.
	3. Otherwise, update the contact manifolds.
	4. Match contacts and transfer contact impulses for warm starting.
	5. Set flags for whether the contact is touching, and whether it started or stopped touching.
3. Combine thread-local bit vectors into a global bit vector with bitwise OR.
4. Serially iterate through set bits using the [count trailing zeros](https://lemire.me/blog/2018/02/21/iterating-over-set-bits-quickly/) method. For each contact pair with a changed status:
	1. If the AABBs are disjoint, send the `CollisionEnded` event (if events are enabled), update `CollidingEntities`, and remove the pair from the `ContactGraph`.
	2. If the colliders started touching, send the `CollisionStarted` event (if events are enabled) and update `CollidingEntities`.
	3. If the AABBs stopped touching, send the `CollisionEnded` event (if events are enabled) and update `CollidingEntities`.

This new approach was largely inspired by [Box2D v3](https://box2d.org/posts/2024/08/releasing-box2d-3.0/).
It allows contacts to be updated in parallel while preserving determinism by processing pair addition and removal
in a fast serial loop iterating over bit vectors. Consider reading the [Simulation Islands] article by Erin Catto
for more details on the general idea (we don't have simulation islands yet, but this builds towards it).

[Simulation Islands]: https://box2d.org/posts/2023/10/simulation-islands/#making-persistent-islands-fast

This improves several aspects:

- The broad phase doesn't need to collect its pairs into a buffer, as it adds them to the `ContactGraph` directly.
- We only iterate through contact pairs *once* every frame for handling contact status changes, using bit scanning intrinsics to only iterate over pairs that actually changed.
- We are mutably iterating over the `ContactGraph` directly, and don't need to do separate lookups for previous contacts or perform any extra allocations.

As you may have noticed, a contact pair now exists between two colliders if their AABBs are touching,
even if the actual shapes aren't. This is important for the pair management logic, though it does mean
that the `ContactGraph` can now have a lot more contact pairs in some cases.

### Contact Graph

Previously, `Collisions` used an `IndexMap` to store collisions, keyed by `(Entity, Entity)`.
The motivation was that we get `Vec`-like iteration speed with preserved insertion order
and fast lookups by entity pairs.

However, there are also scenarios where you may need to iterate over the entities colliding with a given entity,
such as for simulation islands or even gameplay logic. With just an `IndexMap`, this requires iterating over *all* pairs.

**Avian 0.3** replaces `Collisions` with a `ContactGraph` that stores an undirected graph data structure
called `UnGraph`, based on [petgraph](https://github.com/petgraph/petgraph/), simplified and tailored for our use cases.

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct UnGraph<N, E> {
    nodes: Vec<Node<N>>,
    edges: Vec<Edge<E>>,
}
```

For the contact graph, nodes are collider entities, and edges are contact pairs.
However, we still *also* need a way to look up contact pairs by entities.
For this purpose, we have *another* custom data structure called `SparseSecondaryEntityMap`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Slot<T> {
    generation: u32,
    value: T,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct SparseSecondaryEntityMap<V, S: hash::BuildHasher = RandomState> {
    slots: HashMap<u32, Slot<V>, S>,
}
```

It is essentially a sparse map for associating data with entities in a generational arena (the ECS).

<Callout variant="note" title='Comparison to Rapier'>
    The [Rapier](https://rapier.rs/) physics engine uses a dense [`Coarena`] with `ColliderHandle`s for this,
    along with a `HashMap` to map `Entity` IDs to `ColliderHandle`s. This results in double-lookups for user code.

    We are instead using `Entity` directly, which has the side effect that a sparse mapping is needed to avoid
    ballooning memory usage if users have millions of non-physics entities that result in large `Entity` indices.

    [`Coarena`]: https://docs.rs/rapier3d/0.23.1/rapier3d/data/struct.Coarena.html
</Callout>

Additionally, a `HashSet<PairKey>` is used for fast lookups of contact pairs,
where `PairKey` stores a `u64` hash of the two `Entity` indices in ascending order.

So, in summary, the `ContactGraph` is a combination of three data structures:

- `UnGraph<Entity, ContactPair>` for storing the actual undirected contact graph.
- `SparseSecondaryEntityMap<NodeIndex>` for mapping `Entity` IDs to graph node indices.
- `HashSet<PairKey>` for fast lookups of contact pairs.

All of this complexity is abstracted behind an efficient and convenient API with methods like the following:

- `get`, `get_mut`
- `contains`, `contains_key`
- `iter`, `iter_mut`
- `iter_touching`, `iter_touching_mut`
- `collisions_with`, `collisions_with_mut`
- `entities_colliding_with`

and a few ones for adding and removing pairs, primarily intended for internals.

### `Collisions` System Parameter

As described in the [previous section](#contact-graph), the old `Collisions` resource was replaced
by a new `ContactGraph` that contains both touching and non-touching contacts. However, this is inconvenient
for users, as most scenarios will only care about contacts where the colliders are actually touching.

**Avian 0.3** provides a `Collisions` system parameter that wraps the `ContactGraph` with a simpler,
more user-friendly API that only returns touching contact pairs. From the user's perspective,
it is basically identical to the old `Collisions` resource, with the main difference being
that you replace `Res<Collisions>` with just `Collisions` in your systems.


```rust
#[derive(Component)]
struct PressurePlate;

fn activate_pressure_plates(mut query: Query<Entity, With<PressurePlate>>, collisions: Collisions) {
    for pressure_plate in &query {
        // Compute the total impulse applied to the pressure plate.
        let mut total_impulse = 0.0;

        for contact_pair in collisions.collisions_with(pressure_plate) {
            total_impulse += contact_pair.total_normal_impulse_magnitude();
        }

        if total_impulse > 5.0 {
            println!("Pressure plate activated!");
        }
    }
}
```

Unlike in past releases, `Collisions` does not allow mutating or removing contacts.
This limitation is intentional, as contact modification and filtering should typically
be handled via [`CollisionHooks`](#collision-hooks) to behave correctly.

If you need lower-level access to contact pairs, the `ContactGraph` resource can still be used directly.

### Performance

For a 2D pyramid with a base of 50 boxes, a total of 1276 colliders, using 6 substeps,
the performance profile with the `parallel` feature looks like this after 500 steps:

<img alt="Narrow phase performance comparison" src="/blog-assets/avian-0-3/narrow_phase_perf_before_after.png" />

Notably:

- **Narrow Phase**: 4.5x as fast, despite also handling collision events
- **Collision Events**: This whole separate step is gone, and handled by the narrow phase
- **Store Impulses**: From 0.12 ms down to 0.03 ms, because fetching contacts is handled more efficiently
- **Other**: From 0.97 ms down to 0.18 ms, largely due to `wake_on_collision_ended` being removed in favor of much more efficient logic integrated into the narrow phase

Single-threaded performance is also improved, but to a slightly lesser extent.

## Faster Contact Constraint Generation

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['Jondolf']} prs={[699, 712]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

Past releases generated contact constraints in a separate serial step after the narrow phase.
This required iterating through all contact pairs and querying for colliders and bodies a second time.

**Avian 0.3** generates contact constraints directly in the narrow phase, pushing constraints
into buffers that are drained into the `ContactConstraints` resource at the end.
This removes the additional queries and iteration, and makes constraint generation multi-threaded.

<Callout variant="note" title='Multi-threaded determinism'>
    The current implementation results in the constraint generation order being non-deterministic
    when using parallelism. For now, we fix this by sorting the constraints afterwards using
    the original pair indices to retain determinism. In our benchmarks, the cost of sorting seemed
    to be small, as the constraints are already sorted *within* each chunk. Still, we might explore
    ways to optimize this further in the future.
</Callout>

### Performance

In a similar test scene as in the previous section, but with a slightly larger pyramid,
the performance profile with the `parallel` feature looks like this:

<img alt="Contact constraint generation performance comparison" src="/blog-assets/avian-0-3/contact_constraint_generation_before_after.png" />

*Note: The above image is from before we added sorting for the constraints to retain determinism,
but it only adds about 0.03 ms.*

Notably, the narrow phase takes slightly longer, as it now also handles contact constraint generation,
but their combined overhead is much lower than before, from 1.26 ms down to 0.55 ms in this case.

You might also notice that the "Store Impulses" step is more expensive than before.
This is because the contact pair lookup can no longer be performed using the original pair index,
as constraints are generated before contact pair removal, and pair removal can invalidate indices.
One approach I tried is to modify the `ContactGraph` to maintain a stable order for its edge connectivity
(see [#706](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/pull/706)), but it had some potential implications for determinism
that I didn't like, so I left it for future investigation.

## Improved Contact Types

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['Jondolf']} prs={[616, 660, 683, 685]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

As you may have noticed from some code examples, contact types have undergone several changes.
This was done to make things more clear and consistent, and to optimize how contacts are stored.

Some noteworthy mentions:

- `Contacts` has been renamed to `ContactPair`.
- `ContactData` has been renamed to `ContactPoint`.
- `ContactPair` and `ContactManifold` have some new helpers for normal impulses.
- `ContactPair` now stores flags for what kind of contact it is (e.g. `SENSOR`, `TOUCHING`, `CONTACT_EVENTS`), and has helpers such as `is_sensor`.
- `ContactManifold` now stores a single world-space `normal` instead of two local normals.
- `ContactManifold` now stores surface material properties (see [Per-Manifold Material Properties](#per-manifold-material-properties)).

Other than that, the changes are mostly straightforward property renames, method deprecations,
and minor changes to how values are stored. You can see a more complete list of changes
in the migration guide on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/releases/tag/v0.3.0).

## Collider Context

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['oxkitsune', 'aecsocket', 'NiseVoid']} prs={[665]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

Some advanced users require custom collider types that need to obtain additional data
from the ECS, for example for a voxel collider. This was previously not possible,
as the `AnyCollider` trait's methods did not provide ECS access.

**Avian 0.3** adds a `Context` associated type to the `AnyCollider` trait,
allowing you to specify a system parameter to be passed to methods such as
`aabb_with_context` and `contact_manifolds_with_context`.

```rust
#[derive(Component)]
pub struct VoxelCollider;

#[derive(Component)]
pub struct VoxelData {
    // Collider voxel data...
}

impl AnyCollider for VoxelCollider {
    type Context = (
        // You can query for extra components here
        SQuery<&'static VoxelData>,
        // Or use any other read-only system parameter
        SRes<Time>,
    );

    fn aabb_with_context(
        &self,
        position: Vector,
        rotation: impl Into<Rotation>,
        context: AabbContext<Self::Context>,
    ) -> ColliderAabb {
        // Compute the AABB
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn contact_manifolds_with_context(
        &self,
        other: &Self,
        position1: Vector,
        rotation1: impl Into<Rotation>,
        position2: Vector,
        rotation2: impl Into<Rotation>,
        prediction_distance: Scalar,
        context: ContactManifoldContext<Self::Context>,
    ) -> Vec<ContactManifold> {
        let [voxels1, voxels2] = context.0.get_many([context.entity1, context.entity2])
            .expect("our own `VoxelCollider` entities should have `VoxelData`");
        let elapsed = context.1.elapsed();
        // Compute the contact manifolds
        unimplemented!()
    }
}
```

## `ColliderOf` Relationship

<ReleaseNoteMetadata authors={['Jondolf']} prs={[671]} repo={AVIAN_URL} />

Bevy 0.16 introduced initial support for entity-entity [relationships](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-16/#ecs-relationships),
and changed the `Parent` component to a `ChildOf` relationship component.

**Avian 0.3** follows suit, and replaces its `ColliderParent` component with a new `ColliderOf` relationship.
It is used to attach colliders to rigid bodies, and is automatically inserted when adding a collider
on a rigid body or as a descendant of one.

In addition, rigid bodies now track which colliders are attached to them with the `RigidBodyColliders` component.
It is a `RelationshipTarget`, analogous to the `Children` component for parent-child relationships.

## In-Progress Work

This release ended up focusing mostly on the contact pair management rework and related improvements.
I chose it as my focus area, as it was not only important for improving the current collision detection
system, but also helps work towards *other* important features like simulation islands and the BVH broad phase.

However, there was still a *lot* of other exciting work that has been happening in the background,
but didn't make it for 0.3. Instead of the usual "What's Next" section, I thought I'd highlight
some of this ongoing work in a bit more detail to give a better idea of what we've been working on.

### Solver Bodies

Based on typical performance profiles, it is quite clear that we are severely bottlenecked by the solver.
The solver is responsible for actually applying forces and impulses, handling contacts and joints,
and moving bodies based on velocity.

<img alt="Before solver bodies" src="/blog-assets/avian-0-3/before_solver_bodies.png" />

There is a *lot* that we could do to improve the situation. Some of the large but advanced optimizations
include graph coloring to improve parallelism, and wide SIMD constraints to solve several constraints simultaneously,
but there are also lower hanging fruit.

Namely, the ECS appears to be performing rather poorly for random access when fetching bodies required for constraints,
and the body data itself is not stored as efficiently as it could be.

Right now, the solver is basically just iterating through constraints, and fetching a ton of data for the entities
of each constraint using `Query::get`. This involves a lot of overhead.

We can instead contiguously store body data required by the solver in special `SolverBody` structs:

```rust
// This representation is inspired by Box2D v3.
// 32 bytes in total
#[cfg(feature = "2d")]
pub struct SolverBody {
    pub linear_velocity: Vec2, // 8 bytes
    pub angular_velocity: f32, // 4 bytes
    pub delta_position: Vec2,  // 8 bytes
    pub delta_rotation: Rot2,  // 8 bytes
    pub flags: BodyFlags,      // 4 bytes
}

// This representation is my own current design :D
// 16 bytes in total
#[cfg(feature = "2d")]
pub struct SolverBodyInertia {
    // Includes locked axes
    effective_inv_mass: Vec2,   // 8 bytes
    effective_inv_inertia: f32, // 4 bytes
    flags: InertiaFlags,        // 4 bytes
}
```

and sync the results back to the ECS after the solver. The result is a **3x** performance improvement to the solver.

<img alt="After solver bodies" src="/blog-assets/avian-0-3/after_solver_bodies.png" />

Crazy! However, this does unfortunately mean that we are "using the ECS" less, and it makes it more difficult
for users to modify body data manually inside the solver. But I think ultimately this tradeoff will be worth it
for the massive performance gains.

Why didn't I implement this for Avian 0.3 then? It involves large changes to the internals, some of which may break
advanced users. Before I release this to users, I need to test and polish things more, and make sure this doesn't
land in a half-baked state. Still, I hope to merge the initial work early in the release cycle and build more
improvements on top.

### Joint Rework

This has been on the roadmap [ever since Avian 0.1](#whats-next). Despite moving contacts to an impulse-based solver,
we still use XPBD for joints. Due to potential (though unlikely) [patenting risks](#patent), missing features,
and incompatibilities with future optimizations, we want to move joints to an impulse-based solver as well.

It's a massive undertaking, but I finally had some progress towards a prototype, having implemented
functional revolute joints and spherical joints with customizable angle limits.

I would really, really like to finish this in time for 0.4, but we'll just have to see how it goes!

### BVH Broad Phase

Currently, we still use an extremely simple sweep-and-prune algorithm for broad phase collision detection.
While it has worked well enough so far, it has started showing up more in traces as performance
has become a larger focus.

We intend to replace sweep-and-prune with an approach using bounding volume hierarchies (BVH),
with separate trees for active bodies and static or sleeping bodies. @DGriffin91's [OBVHS] crate
is the current front-runner for the BVH implementation, and they have been working on leaf insertion
and removal to better fit our needs.

I've started initial experimentation with the BVH broad phase, but it is still in the early stages.

### Spatial Query Pipeline Rework

Spatial queries are currently directly tied to Parry and the `Collider` type.
This means that alternative collision backends cannot reuse the existing infrastructure
around spatial queries.

Additionally, if we switch to a BVH broad phase, we'd want to reuse the same acceleration structure for spatial queries.
But if we intend to use OBVHS for the broad phase, this wouldn't work as long as spatial queries use Parry's `Qbvh`!

Luckily, @NiseVoid has been working on a new spatial query pipeline that is fully decoupled
from Parry and uses OBVHS for the acceleration structure. If all goes well, it should hopefully
give us much more flexible, backend-agnostic spatial queries.

In the future, we could even consider splitting this further into its own crate,
providing a generic interface for spatial queries in Bevy even without any physics
or collision detection.

### Peck

As I have mentioned a few times in the past, I have been working on my own collision detection library
to use in Avian, as we are currently a bit constrained by Parry. The goal is to have a more Bevy-native
implementation using Bevy's shape primitives, tailored to better fit our needs.

Peck is still in its early stages, but steady progress is being made.
In particular, I have now implemented contact manifold computation for both 2D and 3D,
allowing us to simulate contacts for arbitrary convex shapes:

<video controls>
  <source src="/blog-assets/avian-0-3/peck_contacts_2d.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Additionally, I have implemented analytic solutions for point queries
and closest surface normal queries for most 2D shapes and 3D shapes:

<video controls>
  <source src="/blog-assets/avian-0-3/peck_point_projection_2d.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Finally, @atlv24 has been working on improved GJK and EPA implementations
inspired by [Jolt](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics). Based on initial benchmarks,
it seems to be more than **2x** as fast as Parry's implementation, and there is still more room
for improvement. Exciting stuff! It is currently separate from Peck, but we have started
initial work on adopting it.

### `no_std` Compatibility

Bevy 0.16 got [initial support for `no_std` targets](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-16/#bevy-no-std-support).
While it is unclear how well a full-blown physics engine would work in `no_std`,
it would be cool to try it out, and we made some progress towards it!

I improved `no_std` compatibility in Parry (see [#330](https://github.com/dimforge/parry/pull/330)),
and opened a [PR](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/pull/703) for Avian to add `no_std` support.
However, Parry currently still requires synchronization primitives for some important traits,
breaking support for platforms without them (most retro consoles and embedded systems).
Because of this, I have left it for now, but will revisit it if/when Parry has wider support for `no_std`.

### Force Rework

The current API for forces and impulses is a bit clunky and confusing.
Both `ExternalForce` and `ExternalTorque` as well as `ExternalImpulse` and `ExternalAngularImpulse`
can be either persistent or cleared after every physics step, and applying local forces is difficult.
Additionally, there is no easy way to apply acceleration in a mass-independent way that integrates with substepping.

I have been exploring some alternative approaches, and the current design looks like this:

1. `ConstantForce`, `ConstantTorque`, `ConstantLinearAcceleration`, and `ConstantAngularAcceleration`
   components for persistent forces and torques.
2. `ForceHelper` system parameter for applying one-shot forces, torques, and impulses.
3. Internally, all the forces (and gravity) are combined into `LinearVelocityIncrement` and `AngularVelocityIncrement`
   components, which can be efficiently applied at each substep.

In practice, using the `ForceHelper` system parameter would look roughly like this:

```rust
fn orbit(query: Query<Entity, With<Planet>>, mut forces: ForceHelper) {
    for planet in &query {
        // ...compute gravity force...
        forces.entity(planet)
            .apply_force(gravity_force)
            .apply_local_torque(spin_torque);
    }
}
```

This kind of API would be closer to what you might be used to from other engines,
such as Unity's [`Rigidbody.AddForce`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html)
or Godot's [`RigidBody3D.apply_force`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_rigidbody3d.html#class-rigidbody3d-method-apply-force).
In comparison to the current two components, it provides much more flexibility
and is significantly less error-prone.

### Character Controller Working Group

Most games need a character controller. Over time, several people have implemented their own
versions with various move-and-slide algorithms. Ever since the start of Avian, there has also
been interest in having something official built in.

Recently, out of the blue, an [Avian Character Controller Working Group](https://discord.gg/b4xs9aYY)
was formed! The group is still largely in the prototyping stages, working on test scenes,
iterating on making the core move-and-slide logic rock-solid, and sketching out the high-level
design goals, but it is making steady progress.

The end-goal is to upstream a robust, extensible set of features to allow people to comfortably implement
all sorts of character behavior, while creating examples of more feature-complete character controllers
to demonstrate how the features can be used for different genres.

It is very WIP, but the repository for the current experiments can be found [here](https://github.com/Ploruto/kcc_prototyping).
If you want to see character controllers in Avian, consider joining the effort!

## Support Me
