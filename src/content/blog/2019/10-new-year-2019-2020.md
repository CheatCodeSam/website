Happy New Year's Eve! At midnight tonight we will transition into 2020, the beginning of a new year, the beginning of a whole new decade. I said in a previous post that I would discuss my plans for the beginning year. That's what I'm going to do now.

## My plans for 2020

I will most likely be mostly doing updates to the games this website already has, as well as a couple new games. I would also like to make some kind of admin related stuff for this website (being able to create, edit or delete news posts for example) but I'm not quite sure yet. Below is a list of things I would like to do to this website in 2020.

- Updating current games, adding more content to them
- Making a few new games (one of them I have started)
- Admin system
- Visual improvements
- Overall a slightly better design and layout for the main components of the website
- Making the website even more responsive (works well on screens of all sizes)
- Etc.

It's important to remember that these are things that I **may** do, not things that I **will** do. With all that said, happy New Year!
