I have set up a framework called Vue.js for my website, which makes it a lot easier to maintain and improve and add content. It also adds some challenges like having to learn how Vue.js works and how to utilize it for my needs.

With Vue.js set up, my website is now a single page application. Because of that the website will have to load only once (per visit) so going from, for example, the homepage to the news-page will be almost instant. I haven't properly transferred the games to Vue.js yet, so the code is quite messy and hard to read. Eventually I will try to fully change the games to properly utilize the capabilities of Vue.js but for now it will remain the way it is.

I am now going to address my current plans for this website. I would like to:

-   Improve the visual appearance
-   Add an admin system, which would make it possible to add, edit or delete news-posts from the website itself without having to touch the HTML files. This would also mean making a working database (and learning SQL)
-   Add more games (obviously)
-   Properly utilize Vue.js capabilities, therefore making the code easier to read and maintain
-   Update the current games (which I may or may not discuss in a later news-post)

I also did some minor other changes, mostly fixing typos and updating info on the about-page. That's it for now.
