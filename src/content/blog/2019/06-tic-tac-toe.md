Gamitopia's 3rd game has already been released!

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game that we all know and have played at one point in our lives. If you haven't (and even if you have), play it now and read the rules in the description!
You can play Tic-Tac-Toe [here](/tic-tac-toe)

**\*Note** Currently the game has only one grid size and game mode, so you have to play it locally with someone else (or yourself). Later on I will most likely update the game: add a 4x4 grid, a start menu and an AI to play against.
