So today I already made a post about the randomizer update, but I also made various other changes.

## Improvements and changes

I added proper support for "inline code" text with highlighting such as this: `const epicVariable = 'Inline code snippets are epic';`

I also fixed news post headers so that the sizes and margins go down logically. Earlier they were kind of broken. Below are the new, fixed headers.

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

And lastly, I also added a bunch of images to my old posts, mostly game thumbnails, and removed unnecessary line breaks from them. That decreased the blandness of the posts in my opinion.  

I won't change old news posts drastically, as I want the "history" to stay as is. I will however fix typos, add images or add clarification if it feels necessary, but I won't change the actual content.

## Plans

The corona virus has made me busy with school, so I haven't had that much time to code. I will still try to stick with most of the plans I set earlier on and will try to update the current games. I already did my first update to [Randomizer](/randomizer) and I am planning to update Adventura next, as it has a lot of things that I should fix, update and potentially redo. During the summer I will keep updating the games and will try to develop a small game with Unity. This could be a 2D platformer or a strategy game, I'm not sure yet.

With all that said, stay safe and I'll try to get the next update out fairly soon.
