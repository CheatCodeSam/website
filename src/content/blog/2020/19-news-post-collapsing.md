Today (and yesterday) I implemented news post collapsing.

This basically allows you to collapse or "minimize" the content of the posts. The body of the post disappears smoothly and you will only see the title and the date. This makes it easy to see multiple posts' topics at once without having to scroll down a bunch. You can then expand the posts again to see the main content.

There are two ways to do this. If you want to collapse or expand a single post, you can click the arrow button in the top-right corner of a post. The post will collapse/expand with a smooth transition. If you want to collapse **all** posts to glance at the topics, you can click the button located at the very top of the page. The name of the button is quite descriptive. The button for expanding all posts is right next to it.
