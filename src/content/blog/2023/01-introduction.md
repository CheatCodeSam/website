Hi! This is my personal website where I share my projects and write about whatever science and tech subjects interest me. I like to dive deep into different topics to learn as much as I can, and I plan on making small devlogs or tutorials whenever I have built something interesting based on my research.

You can expect topics like physics simulation, algorithms, web development, game development, or whatever else I find to be interesting at a given time. Currently, I'm really interested in physics simulations and the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org), so I'm developing my own Bevy physics engine called [Bevy XPBD](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd). Stay tuned for a blog post when I release the engine!

In case you are interested in my previous work or what I'm currently working on, you can find me on GitHub as [Jondolf](https://github.com/Jondolf).
