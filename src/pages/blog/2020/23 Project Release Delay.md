title: "Project Release Delay"

A bit over **a month** ago I said I would release a project that I was working on soon. Then I started adding a new feature, but it's taking me way longer than I expected. Now that feature is pretty much finished and I have to just fix some bugs and make some small tweaks. It might still take a week or even a bit longer until I can release it, due to a possible different type of delay that I can't control, which I will quickly address when the project is finished. I'm also becoming a bit bored on working the project, which often happens to me when I have worked on something for a long time. That decreases my efficiency, so it takes longer to finish etc.

Anyway, the project should be finished pretty soon, and I'm looking forward to working on specifically Gamitopia related stuff again. I probably won't do anything big right after the release of the project and will just chill and play some games for a bit.
