I haven't made any posts or updates to Gamitopia in a while, so I decided to make a quick update on what I've been doing. I won't tell too much details though.

So I've been coding a lot for the last few weeks and I have been working on a game/app. It's quite different from what I've done so far and uses different technologies, which involves a learning curve. I have learned a lot while working on "this project" and some of those things will probably carry over to working on Gamitopia.

This is probably the first "project" of mine that will actually be useful for me outside of Gamitopia and I'm quite excited about it. The project isn't necessarily that big, but it involves quite a lot of different things.

The project will most likely be finished next week, or if everything goes well then this weekend. I'll publish it in some way or form to Gamitopia and the repository will be on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Jondolf).

This was just a quick checkup on what I've been doing and what's to come. I'll make another post or two when the project comes out.
