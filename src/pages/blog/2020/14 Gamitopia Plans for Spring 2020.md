In Spring of 2020 I am planning to:

-   Publish at least one new game
-   Update current games
    -   Cookie Clicker: add more content, add fullscreen
    -   Randomizer: add multiple more things to randomize, improve UI and mobile support
    -   Tic-Tac-Toe: improve visuals and UI, maybe add AI to play against
    -   Adventura: add new areas and abilities, improve mobile support
    -   Snake: add setting to disable and/or generate random walls
-   Add news post tags
-   Improve overall site layout and design
-   Clean up code
-   Etc.

Now that that list is dealt with, I'll quickly talk about some of these plans. I have already started to work on a game, but it is very, very basic at the moment and has no proper game mechanics yet. I won't say what the game is about yet in case I end up not making the game at all due to the amount of work I would have to do. The game artistically is about the same as Adventura if not even better.

The news post tags would basically just quickly tell what type of news post it is. For example there might be tags like: Game, Backend, Feature and so on. Each tag would have a name (as mentioned) and a color. Then I could also improve the news post filtering system to filter by tag so that you would only see news posts that have that tag.

Improving the site layout and design could include a better about page, a hamburger menu for navigation on mobile, better "game boxes" with a potential description and more. As a side note, I'm looking forward to properly seeing what Vue 3 has to offer when it officially releases, mainly the new and debated Composition API.
