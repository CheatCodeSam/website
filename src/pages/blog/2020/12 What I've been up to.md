So for the past month I have been doing a lot of very different stuff. At the start of January I made a small update to Cookie Clicker which involved transferring it to Vue properly, updating the visuals a bit, adding some animations etc. I also added a simple filter system to the news page (as you can see if you look at the top of this page) that enables you to filter the news posts by year.

The different thing that I mentioned is Unity. I have learnt the very basics of the Unity Game Engine and C# and made some small test games: an FPS test with physics, Pong (the old game with the two paddles moving up and down and a ball bouncing off of them) and a tiny platformer test. I made these tests just to see how the game engine works and if it's something I could actually learn (it is). I have also always wanted to learn it as I want to make bigger, better games.

The point of this post was to inform you of what I've been doing. I also believe that it's possible to transport Unity games to the web so if it works this site might get some more games fairly soon.
