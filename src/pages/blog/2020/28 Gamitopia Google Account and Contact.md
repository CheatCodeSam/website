I had to create a new Google account for Gamitopia to make a Google Play Console developer account. I hadn't thought about creating a Google account for Gamitopia before, but it's actually really handy. I can now store all Gamitopia related stuff like images or ideas in Google Drive. Earlier I had some stuff like that in OneDrive on my personal account, but now it's more nicely organized on the Google account.

Another really nice thing is that it of course makes a Gmail account as well, so now you can contact me about Gamitopia related stuff if you want.

The email address is **gamitopia@gmail.com**
