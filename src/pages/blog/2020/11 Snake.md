Yet another game has been released, and this one is a classic.

Slither around as a snake as you collect fruit and grow bigger to increase your score. If you hit a wall or your own tail, your snake dies and you will have to try again.

I also added a settings menu where you can make the game a lot more interesting by changing the size of the game area or increasing/decreasing the speed of your snake. I will update the game later this year by adding settings that will generate random walls around the game area whenever you restart to make navigating around a lot more interesting, settings to maybe change the color of the snake and the walls, settings to change how often fruit spawns and settings to choose if you want the snake's speed to change whenever you get a fruit.
