Merry Christmas everyone! Unfortunately this blog is the only Christmas related thing I will be able to do for Gamitopia this Christmas as I have been very busy with school and the new game that I have been making for over a month (the next blog will be about that).

While it's not necessarily Christmas related, the new game that I mentioned, Adventura is now released! It's my most impressive game so far and I'm really proud of it and I hope you'll enjoy playing it!

I also made some minor changes to the website. I added an About Me section to the About page and highlighted the lists on the News page. Now that the game is officially released and I have a break from school, I'll most likely take a little break from coding actively. I do however have some plans for the future of this website and I will address them in a future blog coming on New Years Eve. With that said I wish you a Merry Cristmas and a happy new year.
