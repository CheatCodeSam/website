The second game on Gamitopia, Randomizer, is now published!

In Randomizer, you can get random things like numbers and more by pressing a button. Open a menu to choose what to randomize. Currently Randomizer has only three things to randomize, but more will come later on.

You can play Randomizer [here](/randomizer)
