For those who are looking at screens late at night or just like dark colors, the dark theme has been added! Press the icon at the top-left corner to activate it. Press the icon again to go back to light mode. Your choice of the theme will be saved, so if you had dark theme on when you left the website, it will stay the same when you come back. Note that all games may not support the dark theme so some games may appear quite bright when the dark theme is on.
